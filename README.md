# ch14-weather-app

## Introduction

This weather app is my first project as part of The Jump Digital School's 14th cohort Software Engineering Course. It uses the [open weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data from destinations from around the world.

## user stories

The user is able to

- See the weather from where they are currently located. Note this will require the user allowing location services in their settings.
- Search city locations around the world and add to their favorites section on the landing page
- For every weather card of a city they can navigate through to a more detailed forecast, including wind speeds, humidity and weather for the next few days.

## installation

Currently the app can only be run via VS Code live server, but will be deployed to a suitable website in the near future.
